    <p>My name is Michael Sendle.  My dream job is to be an engineer, working with computers. I have always been interested in technology since I was little. I am fascinated by things like space, more recently military technology like tanks and weapon systems. I also love video games. Some of the games I’ve played are Destiny, Halo 4, Halo Reach, Halo 3, Halo 3 ODST, Halo The Master Chief Collection (MCC), Minecraft, the main Pokémon games, some of the Pokémon mystery dungeon gams, some of the Mario games also there spinoff titles, and Warface. My favorite games right now are Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Fallout 4, Skyrim, and World of Tanks Blitz.</p>
